# Python Learning Projects

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects designed to support a gradual learning path — from beginner exercises to advanced, production-ready applications.

## What's Inside

- **Progressive learning** — Projects increase in complexity, covering both foundational skills and advanced patterns.
- **Real-world focus** — Each project solves a concrete problem or simulates a real application scenario.

## Who Is This For?

- Python learners looking for real, hands-on projects
- Developers seeking reference implementations for common tasks
- Anyone building a project portfolio

ה## 📘 Topics Covered (Python Skills Roadmap)

Each project in this repository helps build mastery in real-world Python topics.  
The topics are organized by skill level: from foundational programming to scalable system design.

---

### 🟢 Beginner – Python Foundations

- **Variables & Data Types** – numbers, strings, booleans, etc.
- **Control Flow** – `if` statements, `for` and `while` loops
- **Functions** – defining, calling, parameters, return values
- **Collections** – lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- **File I/O** – reading and writing from `.txt` and `.csv` files
- **Error Handling** – using `try`/`except` to catch exceptions
- **Basic Imports** – using built-in modules like `math`, `random`

---

### 🟡 Intermediate – Python for Projects

- **Object-Oriented Programming** – classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Working with External Libraries** – e.g. `pygame`, `pandas`, `requests`
- **Modules & Packages** – organizing code into reusable components
- **Virtual Environments** – managing dependencies with `venv` and `requirements.txt`
- **Working with Data Formats** – JSON, CSV, and APIs
- **Decorators & Higher-Order Functions** – passing and returning functions
- **Simple GUI Apps** – using `pygame`, `tkinter`, or `streamlit`
- **Unit Testing** – writing tests with `unittest` and TDD principles
- **Git & GitHub** – version control, branches, pull requests

---

### 🔴 Advanced – Python for Scalable Systems

- **Design Patterns** – Singleton, Factory, Strategy, etc.
- **Advanced OOP** – composition, polymorphism, magic methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)
- **Functional Programming** – `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- **Generators & Iterators** – memory-efficient data flows
- **Concurrency** – `threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`
- **Custom Python Packages** – structuring and publishing your own libraries
- **Performance Optimization** – profiling, bottlenecks, efficient code
- **Clean Code & Architecture** – SOLID principles, documentation, readability
- **Deployment & Containers** – packaging with Docker, running apps on servers

✅ *Each project in this repo targets specific topics from this list — you can use it to track your learning journey and growth as a Python developer.*


---

Each project in this repo is mapped to at least one of these topics.
