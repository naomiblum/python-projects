# 🧠 FlowSense – The Story Behind the System

> “Hey Naomi, can you check why the team keeps missing internal deadlines?”

That was the message I got one morning.  
I had just started working as a junior data analyst in a tech team. I didn’t have access to high-level strategy or team meetings — but I did have access to the logs.

📁 So I opened them.

We had:
- Task start/end timestamps
- Assignee names
- Status flags
- Response and completion times

What we **didn’t have** was insight.

## 🧩 The Problem No One Could Describe

The team *looked* productive:  
Tasks were being marked as done, commits were going through, and everyone seemed busy.

But still —  
- Deadlines were slipping  
- People felt blocked  
- And everyone pointed in different directions

When I asked for clarity, I got answers like:  
> “I don’t know, something just feels... off.”

## 🔍 Asking Better Questions

Instead of asking “what got done?” —  
I started asking:

- Who gets assigned tasks that loop back to others?
- Where are tasks sitting longest?
- Who is responding slower over time?
- Which patterns are repeating silently?

I wasn’t looking for blame. I was looking for *flow disruption*.

## 🧠 FlowSense Was Born

I started writing Python code:
- Cleaned the data with `pandas`
- Calculated behavioral KPIs: task lag, response time, throughput
- Clustered users by behavior (KMeans)
- Visualized task flows with `seaborn`
- Exported graphs, patterns, and summaries

I called it **FlowSense** — a behavioral mirror for teams.

## 📈 What It Revealed

Some things were surprising, others confirmed what people felt but couldn’t prove:

- Two people were indirectly involved in nearly every delayed task  
- A feedback loop between two team members caused silent rework  
- Task volume looked fine, but response time had doubled over 3 weeks  
- Several “owners” weren’t actually the ones closing tasks

---

## 🔄 The Outcome

After sharing the graphs and insights:
- Management realigned task distribution
- Certain bottlenecks were addressed openly
- The team velocity **increased**, without adding anyone

Most importantly:  
People felt seen.  
No one was blamed — just understood.

And me? I realized this is the kind of work I want to keep doing.  
**FlowSense isn’t just a project. It’s the kind of problem I want to solve.**
